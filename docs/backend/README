This document is to serve as an overview for the backend implementation of
Pigeon.

Pigeon uses node-cron to run update functions that fetch API data and store it
in mongo. An example module used for weather can be found at
app/sources/weather.js in the repository. The module pulls data from
OpenWeatherMap's API, then reformats the data and stores it in mongo for the
frontend to use. These functions are called periodically via node-cron, as seen
in app/sources/dispatch.js.
